# AI Toolkit - PRD

## Vision

A curated repository of proven AI configurations, commands, workflows, and code patterns for solo developers who want ready-to-use AI tooling without the experimental noise.

## Target User

Solo developer who wants ready-to-use AI tooling.

## Core Features (Priority Order)

1. **Reusable prompts and commands** - Slash commands, prompt templates, agent definitions (provider-agnostic where possible)
2. **Tool configurations** - Settings and configs for AI tools (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, MCP servers, etc.)
3. **Code patterns** - Proven integration code and utilities
4. **Documentation** - Usage guides and customization instructions

## Non-Goals

- Not experimental (that's ai-playground)
- Not project-specific code
- Not a framework or library to install as a dependency
- Not tutorials or learning content (docs are for immediate usage, not teaching)

## Success Criteria

- Items graduate here from ai-playground when proven useful
- Things from this repo get reused in real projects
- Adding something new takes minutes, not hours (good structure)
- Other devs could fork/clone and get value immediately
