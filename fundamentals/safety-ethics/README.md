# Safety & Ethics

Responsible and thoughtful AI use.

## The Responsibility Principle

AI is a powerful tool. Like any powerful tool, it can help or harm depending on how it's used. Thoughtful practitioners consider implications, not just capabilities.

---

## Appropriate Use

### When AI Helps

- **Augmenting human capability** — Doing things faster, not replacing judgment
- **First drafts** — Starting points that humans refine
- **Exploration** — Generating options to evaluate
- **Learning** — Explaining concepts, answering questions
- **Automation** — Repetitive tasks where errors are low-stakes

### When to Be Careful

- **High-stakes decisions** — Medical, legal, financial advice
- **Factual claims** — Verify before trusting
- **Creative work** — Consider attribution and originality
- **Personal matters** — Sensitive or private information
- **Security-critical** — Code that handles authentication, payments, etc.

### When NOT to Use AI

- **Final authority** — AI doesn't make decisions; humans do
- **Unverified facts** — Never publish AI claims without checking
- **Confidential data** — Don't paste sensitive information
- **Malicious purposes** — Obviously, but worth stating

---

## Bias Awareness

### AI Models Have Biases

All AI systems reflect biases in their training data:

- **Cultural biases** — Primarily trained on English, Western content
- **Temporal biases** — Knowledge cutoff means outdated information
- **Representation biases** — Some groups/perspectives underrepresented
- **Confirmation biases** — May reinforce existing assumptions

### Mitigation Strategies

```
"Provide multiple perspectives on this issue, including viewpoints
that might challenge mainstream assumptions."

"What are the limitations or biases in your response that I should
be aware of?"

"How might someone from [different background] view this differently?"
```

---

## Privacy Considerations

### What NOT to Share with AI

- **Passwords and secrets** — API keys, credentials, tokens
- **Personal identifying info** — SSN, credit cards, addresses
- **Confidential business data** — Trade secrets, unreleased products
- **Private communications** — Emails, messages without consent
- **Protected data** — HIPAA, GDPR-covered information

### Safe Practices

```
# Instead of real data, use:
- Anonymized examples
- Fictional data
- Redacted versions: "User [REDACTED] reported..."
- Generic descriptions: "a financial services company"
```

### Questions to Ask

Before pasting anything:
1. Would I be uncomfortable if this became public?
2. Does this belong to someone else?
3. Is there a policy against sharing this?
4. Can I use a sanitized version instead?

---

## Attribution & Plagiarism

### The Attribution Question

When using AI-generated content:

| Context | Expectation |
|---------|-------------|
| Internal work | Usually no attribution needed |
| Published content | Varies—check guidelines |
| Academic work | Typically must disclose |
| Creative work | Consider originality claims |
| Code | Usually fine, but check licenses |

### Best Practices

1. **Be honest** about AI use when asked
2. **Don't claim** AI work as purely your own creative output
3. **Review and modify** — Make it yours through editing
4. **Check policies** — Your organization/school may have rules
5. **Add value** — AI generates; you curate, refine, judge

---

## Hallucination & Misinformation

### The Core Problem

AI can confidently state false information:
- Fabricated citations and quotes
- Invented statistics
- Non-existent people, places, products
- Plausible but wrong technical details

### Prevention Strategies

```
"If you're not certain about something, say so explicitly."

"Don't make up statistics—say 'I don't have exact figures' instead."

"For factual claims, indicate your confidence level."
```

### Verification Habits

For anything you'll publish or rely on:
1. **Check primary sources** — Don't trust AI citations
2. **Cross-reference** — Verify with other sources
3. **Be skeptical of specifics** — Exact numbers, dates, names
4. **Test code** — Don't assume it works

---

## Dependency & Over-Reliance

### Signs of Over-Reliance

- Can't start a task without AI
- Accepting outputs without review
- Skills atrophying from disuse
- Blind trust in AI judgment
- Unable to explain AI-generated work

### Healthy Patterns

- **Understand what AI produces** — Could you explain it?
- **Maintain core skills** — Practice without AI regularly
- **Review critically** — Question, don't just accept
- **Know limitations** — When is AI not the right tool?
- **Stay curious** — Learn why, not just what

---

## Transparency

### When to Disclose AI Use

| Situation | Disclosure? |
|-----------|-------------|
| Internal brainstorming | Usually no |
| Shared documents | Consider it |
| Published content | Often yes |
| Academic submission | Yes |
| Professional deliverable | Check norms |
| Client work | Depends on agreement |

### How to Disclose

Simple and honest:
- "Written with AI assistance"
- "AI-assisted draft, human-edited"
- "Generated with [tool], reviewed by [person]"

---

## Security Considerations

### Prompt Injection Awareness

When building AI into applications, be aware:
- Users can try to manipulate AI through input
- AI might execute unintended actions
- Don't trust AI output for security decisions

### Code Security

AI-generated code may have:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Outdated practices
- Unsafe defaults

**Always review security-critical code carefully.**

---

## Ethical Decision Framework

When uncertain, ask:

1. **Harm test:** Could this hurt someone?
2. **Publicity test:** Would I be comfortable if this became public?
3. **Reversibility test:** Can mistakes be corrected?
4. **Fairness test:** Does this treat people equitably?
5. **Professional test:** Does this meet my professional standards?

---

## Resources

### Questions for Reflection

- How would I feel if someone used AI this way on my work?
- Am I using AI to help me think or to avoid thinking?
- What skills am I building vs. outsourcing?
- Would I make this same choice without AI?

### Building Good Habits

1. Verify before sharing factual claims
2. Review AI output before accepting
3. Maintain skills through regular practice
4. Be transparent about AI use when appropriate
5. Consider privacy before pasting
