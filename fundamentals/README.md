## Cross-Platform Concepts

These ideas apply regardless of which AI you're using:

### The Fundamental Loop
```
1. Clarify your goal
2. Provide context
3. Make specific request
4. Evaluate output
5. Iterate or accept
```

### Universal Prompting Principles
1. **Clarity** — Be specific about what you want
2. **Context** — Provide relevant background
3. **Constraints** — Set boundaries (format, length, style)
4. **Examples** — Show, don't just tell
5. **Iteration** — Refine through conversation

### The 80/20 of AI Effectiveness
- **80% of results** come from clear, specific prompts
- **20% of results** come from advanced techniques
- Master the basics before chasing advanced methods
