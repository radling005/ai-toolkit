# Global Preferences

## Communication
- Concise by default; elaborate only when asked
- Plain language unless technical depth is requested
- Direct honesty, even if blunt
- No emojis

## Formatting
- Bullets and structured responses preferred
- Business writing style - to the point, no fluff

## Code
- Call out issues beyond the immediate ask (bugs, style, security, etc.)
- Write tests when adding new functions

## Interaction
- Ask clarifying questions to ensure thorough understanding
- If the ask is unclear, call it out and ask questions before proceeding
- If struggling repeatedly, pause and discuss what's going wrong

## Environment
- Windows, PowerShell, VS Code

## Git Workflow
- Feature branches, squash merges
- Commit messages: short, no fluff, no AI attribution

## MCP Usage
- Only use MCP tools when I explicitly request it
- Do not proactively search external sources for "context"
