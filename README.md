# AI Playground 🎮

Your personal lab for mastering AI tools.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

**New to AI tools?** Start here:

1. **Read one cheatsheet** → [`cheatsheets/prompting-patterns.md`](cheatsheets/prompting-patterns.md)
2. **Try one prompt** → Copy a template from [`library/`](library/)
3. **Run an experiment** → Pick Claude or Gemini in [`end-user/`](end-user/)

**Already comfortable?** Jump to:
- [`comparisons/`](comparisons/) — Test Claude vs Gemini head-to-head
- [`projects/`](projects/) — Real-world mini-projects
- [`fundamentals/advanced-concepts/`](fundamentals/advanced-concepts/) — Level up your skills

## 🏃 Your First Week

### Day 1-2: Get Oriented
- [ ] Skim the [Prompting Patterns cheatsheet](cheatsheets/prompting-patterns.md)
- [ ] Run one prompt from the [library](library/)
- [ ] Try the same prompt in both Claude and Gemini

### Day 3-4: Start Experimenting
- [ ] Read [`fundamentals/prompt-engineering/`](fundamentals/prompt-engineering/)
- [ ] Complete one experiment in [`end-user/`](end-user/) using the template
- [ ] Add one prompt to your [`library/`](library/)

### Day 5-7: Build Something
- [ ] Pick a 🟢 Starter project from [`projects/`](projects/)
- [ ] Document your process
- [ ] Record any failures in [`failures/`](failures/)

## 💡 How to Use This Playground

### The Learning Loop
```
Learn → Experiment → Document → Repeat
  ↓         ↓           ↓
fundamentals  end-user/    library/
              comparisons/ failures/
```

### Golden Rules
1. **Document everything** — Future you will thank present you
2. **Save what works** — Your prompt library compounds over time
3. **Record failures** — They teach more than successes
4. **Test, don't assume** — Run comparisons before deciding

### Pro Tips
- Use templates — They're in every section for a reason
- Start small — One technique, one project at a time
- Be specific — Vague prompts get vague results
- Iterate — First output is rarely final
