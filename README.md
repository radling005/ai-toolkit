## Structure

### `fundamentals/`

**Vendor-agnostic AI skills that transfer across all platforms.**

Core topics:
- **Prompt Engineering** — Zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, and more
- **Workflows** — Patterns for integrating AI into your work
- **Context Management** — Optimizing what you feed the AI
- **Output Quality** — Getting consistently good results
- **Use Cases** — Domain-specific patterns (coding, writing, analysis)
- **Safety & Ethics** — Responsible AI use
- **Evaluation** — Measuring and comparing AI outputs
- **Advanced Concepts** — Agentic AI, RAG, multi-modal strategies
- **Practical Skills** — Day-to-day effectiveness

Start here: [`fundamentals/README.md`](fundamentals/README.md)

### `end-user/`

**Structured learning labs for UI-based experimentation.**

#### Claude (`end-user/claude/`)
Experiments with Claude's web interface:
- Prompt engineering practice
- Artifacts (React, HTML, SVG, Mermaid)
- Extended thinking exploration
- Projects and knowledge management

#### Gemini (`end-user/gemini/`)
Experiments with Gemini's web interface:
- Search grounding techniques
- Code execution and data analysis
- Gems (custom personas)
- Multi-modal capabilities

Each includes:
- Organized folder structure
- Experiment templates
- Effective prompts collection
- Edge cases documentation

---

### `api/`

**Programmatic experimentation and SDK usage.**

#### Claude (`api/claude/`)
Python scripts using the Anthropic Claude API.
- Hello world example
- SDK patterns

#### Gemini (`api/gemini/`)
Python scripts using the Google Gemini API.
- Hello world example
- SDK patterns

## Learning Path

### Week 1-2: Foundations
1. Read `fundamentals/prompt-engineering/`
2. Complete beginner exercises
3. Start experimenting in `end-user/claude/` or `end-user/gemini/`

### Week 3-4: Building Skills
4. Study `fundamentals/workflows/` and `fundamentals/output-quality/`
5. Document your experiments using the templates
6. Build a personal prompt library

### Week 5-6: Specialization
7. Deep dive into `fundamentals/use-cases/` for your domain
8. Compare Claude vs Gemini for different tasks
9. Explore `fundamentals/advanced-concepts/`

### Ongoing
- Maintain your prompt library
- Document new patterns
- Review `fundamentals/safety-ethics/`
- Share learnings

## Philosophy

This playground is built on deliberate practice:
- **Learn** the fundamentals that transfer across tools
- **Experiment** systematically, not randomly
- **Document** what works and what doesn't
- **Iterate** on your techniques over time

The goal isn't just to use AI — it's to understand it deeply.
